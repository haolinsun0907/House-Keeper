# House-Keeper

## Introduction
In this project, I developed an Android application on Android studio called “Housekeeper”. The purpose of this application is to apply C2C model to help individuals provide and book some house-keeping services. Just like Uber and Airbnb, people who have the capability to do the house-keeping services can post their provided services and their hourly rate on the app; people who are looking for house-keeping services can also contact the service providers for the services and rate their services. It is a totally free app for the training purposes and it means to provide people an easier way to manage their house work and provide some jobs.
